# Contributing

If you wish to contribute on the codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **v13** branch
2. Run `yarn --immutable`
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run `yarn lint` to run ESLint
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/Rygent/discord.js-template/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](./COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
